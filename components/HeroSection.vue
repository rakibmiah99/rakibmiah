        As a web developer, providing a qualitative web-application with a flexible architecture, structured JSON/XML with a flawless API connectivity interface, well-constructed code following the OOPs concept and a seamless development cycle are my standards. 

Developing applications in PHP using the Laravel framework and my expertise in the developer tools like PhpStorm and skills in MySQL, PostgreSQL etc has brought me this far and has allowed me to get involved in complete application development from scratch.  
Complex bug fixes, corner case handling and architecture builds are the major areas that I am good at and like to play with. My Services include APIs, optimizations, cache, queuing, monitoring, and you'll get all the expected with professionalism. Frontend development with the help of HTML, CSS, Javascript is also the area I worked at
